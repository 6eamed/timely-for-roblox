# timely-for-roblox
Will count the amount of time that Roblox has been open; includes multiple saves for different games.

# FAQ
- Does Timely inject ANYTHING into ROBLOX? No. Timely detects if the ROBLOX process is running, then starts the timer.
- Does this work with the ROBLOX app? Yep, you can change the process name.
- How do I change the process name? Well.. by default Timely is set to detect the Windows 10 app "p = Process.GetProcessesByName("Windows10Universal")". You may change the process name from "Windows10Universal" to "RobloxPlayerBeta".

# What is the difference between versions U and R?
- If you're looking to count time for the Microsoft Store ROBLOX app, use the Universal // U version; otherwise, use the Normal // R version.
