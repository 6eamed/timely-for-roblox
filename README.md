# Timely for ROBLOX
Will count the amount of time that Roblox has been open; includes multiple saves for different games.

# FAQ
- Does Timely inject ANYTHING into ROBLOX? || No. Timely detects if the ROBLOX process is running, then starts the timer.
- Does this work with the ROBLOX app? || Yep, you can change the process name.
- How do I change the process name? || Well.. by default Timely is set to detect the "RobloxPlayerBeta" process, but you can set the process to "Windows10Universal" which will detect the Microsoft Store version of ROBLOX.

# What is the difference between versions U and R?
- If you're looking to use timely with the Microsoft Store ROBLOX app, use the Universal // U version; otherwise, use the Normal // R version.
